## Analyzing the operation and design of a Jaw Crusher .
The jaw crusher's moving jaw undergoes two main types of motion, one resulting from the eccentric shaft movement, and the second from the toggle plate and the tension rod. Using simulation and the Discrete Element Method (DEM) it is possible to model the complex crushing process in order to optimize the operation and design of the machine.
