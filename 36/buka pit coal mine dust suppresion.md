To mitigate the dust dispersion pollution in the open‐pit coal mines, this study experimentally develops a novel environmentally friendly coal dust suppressant. The experiment uses naturally biodegradable soybean protein isolate (SPI) as the main material and utilizes anion surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to modify SPI.

These control measures will prevent coarser dust (10 microns and larger) from becoming airborne and will reduce overall dust throughout an open-pit mine. However, low pressure watering does not actively subdue dust particles that are already airborne or respirable sized dust particles which are less than 10 microns (PM10 dust).

## Sweeping Dust-A-Side from pit to port - Safe To Work
Dust-A-Side discusses its range of dust suppression solutions for all areas of the mine site. Dus t particles may be small, but they can mean big problems for mining operations. Prolonged exposure to dust generated from pit, haul roads and processing may cause potential long-term health issues such as silicosis or black lung disease.

## Mine dust and you - Fact sheets - NSW Health
Concerns about amenity from mine site dust often relate to "visibility" of dust plumes and dust sources. Visible dust is usually due to short-term episodes of high emissions, such as from blasting. Other amenity impacts include dust depositing on fabrics (such as washing) or on house roofs, and the transport of dust from roofs to water tanks, during rain.
