## Surface mining methods - an overview - Basic Mining .
Open pit (open cut) mining method is applied on shallow, non-stratified, and massive deposit like porphyry copper-gold, iron ore, uranium. The overburden is stripped to expose the ore. Multiple benches are established to reach the economic pit limit.

## Slate Mining In Wales - Giftware Wales
Slate mining has long been a form of industry in Wales and while South Wales was rich with Black Gold (Coal Mining) then North Wales has been equally blessed with Slate. Slate is formed when mud with high levels of clay was compacted and squeezed t high temperature during continental shifts some million years ago.

## Slate | Minerals Education Coalition
Slate is often mined in open pit quarries. Methods vary depending on variations in the physical properties of the deposit itself, such as density, fracturing/bedding planes and depth. The process is relatively simple: locate or create breaks in the stone, remove the stone using heavy machinery, secure the stone on a vehicle for transport, and move the material to storage and processing.
