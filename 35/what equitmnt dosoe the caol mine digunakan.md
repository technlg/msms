## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity.Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. and for cement production.

## Coal prices and outlook - U.S. Energy Information .
Coking coal must be low in sulfur and requires more thorough cleaning than coal used in power plants, which makes the coal more expensive. In 2019, the average delivered price of coking coal to coke producers was about $146 per short ton—almost four times higher than the average price of coal delivered to the electric power sector.
