Gyratory crusher is a new type of crusher which can replace fine jaw crusher or cone crusher. The gyratory crushing equipment has a bright future in the mineral processing market. Its working part is a high-speed rotary crushing roller, which is coupled with a pair of curved crushing plates arranged symmetrically on the left and the right to form two optimal crushing cavities for the pliers.
