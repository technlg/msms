Horizontal conching machine has been designed for cocoa mass degassing, homogenization and dry conching of chocolate and using a balls mill for refining process. Chocolate will be beat against conche's walls through a continuous mechanical movement ffected by special agitators placed inside the tank which allows the extraction of humidity and acidity.

## High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis
It is a ball milling process where a powder mixture placed in the ball mill is subjected to high-energy collision from the balls. This process was developed by Benjamin and his coworkers at the International Nickel Company in the late of 1960.

## How I built a quick and easy home-made ball mill
How I built a home-made, quick and easy ball mill, that can also be used as a rock tumbler. Anyone who has looked through my web site can see that I am fascinated with glass. I like to melt it, cast it, fuse it and turn it into new things.

## Ball Milling - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Ball milling of graphite with appropriate stabilizers is another mode of exfoliation in liquid phase. 21 Graphite is ground under high sheer rates with millimeter-sized metal balls causing exfoliation to graphene (Fig. 2.5), under wet or dry conditions.For instance, this

## Drilling vs Boring vs Reaming: What's the Difference? - .
Drilling, boring, and reaming are all different cutting processes. Each process is different. Drilling creates a circular-shape in the product. Boring and reaming both use the hole created from drilling. Reaming creates smooth walls in the drill hole. Boring enlarges the

## Conching - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Conching. Conching is performed in round or oblong rotary conche pots in which the chocolate mass is mixed, ground, and kneaded at temperatures of 65–75°C. Conching times vary from a few hours to many days, depending on the desired final chocolate quality. From: Encyclopedia of Food and Health, 2016. Download as PDF.
