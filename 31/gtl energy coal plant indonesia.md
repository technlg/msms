## GTL Energy - SourceWatch
GTL will be operating a new drying plant in southwestern North Dakota that will remove water from over 1 million pounds of coal transported from New Zealand. The plant will remove water from the low-quality but abundant lignite coal and then ship it back to its country of origin. The plant is designed to process 240,000 tons of lignite annually.
