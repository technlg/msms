## Cone Crusher Or Gyratory
HGT Gyratory Crusher is mainly composed of the beam, frame, moving cone, eccentric sleeve, transmission part and hydraulic cylinder. Driven by the motor, the horizontal shaft starts to rotate which then further makes the eccentric sleeve rotate under the assistance of gear.

## Gyratory and Cone Crusher
Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and developed by Gates around 1881 and was referred to as a Gates Crusher . The smaller form is described as a cone crusher. The larger crushers are normally known as primary crushers as they are designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly from the mines.

## Gyratory And Cone Crushers – Met Dynamics
The KCM can simulate wear in both gyratory and cone crushers, with or without regulated setting controls. The wear simulation allows a user to predict the economically optimal time to replace liners, given any set of material type, duty, throughput and product quality requirements.

## Gyratory VS Jaw Crushers: Advantages & Disadvantages
No discussion of primary crusher selection would be complete without a comparison of the two leading types: the standard gyratory crusher and the Blake jaw crusher. Although their fields of application overlap to a considerable degree (at least in the realm of primary crushing) there is no real conflict between these two machines; one supplements the other and, between them they very
