## How ball mill works?
The ball mill is a hollow drum closed with loading and unloading end caps, filled with grinding media and rotated around its axis.The drum of the ball mill (Pic. 1) is a hollow cylinder of steel, lined inside with armor lining plates which protect it from impact and .

## Cement mill
A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage[1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.

## Variables in Ball Mill Operation | Paul O. Abbe®
The formula for critical speed is CS = 1/2π √ (g/ (R-r) where g is the gravitational constant, R is the inside diameter of the mill and r is the diameter of one piece of media. This reduced to CS = 265.45/√ (R-r). Dry mills typically operate in the range of 50%-70% of CS and most often between 60%-65% of CS.
