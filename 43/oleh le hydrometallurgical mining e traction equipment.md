## E-Waste: Metal Pollution Threat or Metal Resource?
Bio hydrometallurgical recovery of metals from E-waste appears to be an attractive treatment technique, which can result in more than 90% of metal extraction. This would lead to an acceptable solution of some of the metallic pollutants and would provide value-added metal recovery thereby helping to compensate the gap between the demand and supply of metals.
