The Jameson Cell is a radically different flotation device that changed the way that minerals were recovered and earned Jameson almost legendary status in mining and engineering circles. With over 300 cells now in operation across 25 countries, the Cell is being used for copper, coal, zinc, nickel, lead, silver and platinum extraction world-wide.
